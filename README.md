This was originally created as a project for the Tim Buchalka's Udemy course, Java Masterclass - Become an App Developer.

This Java-coded Android app is a simple four-function calculator. Use the on-screen buttons to tap in a number, an operation, and another number -

Then hit enter to see the exciting result!

The "C" button clears the currently entered number. After tapping it once, it will change from "C" to "A". Tapping "A" will clear the current operation as well - in the photo below, the plus can be removed by hitting "A"

The app has portrait and landscape layouts to adopt to different screen orientations.
